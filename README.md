# Component
Estimated task time **2 working days.** (possibly more or less). Please commit gradually to see progress of task completion.
Please use React (in away you want), CSS/SCSS/less/Styled components does not matter


Main objective:

![role](materials/role-module.png)

Make component with UI **look-alike** on sceenshot (don't spent too much time possibly to use library or standart html). 

Inside dropdown should have:
 - Save button
 - Dropdown **predefined values** (User, Member, Admin) (+ if you do bonus "Custom" role)
 - Changed predefined values(User, Member, Admin) in dropdown will update state of checkboxes to different values
    - All predefined roles will have **no possibility(read-only)** to change values of checkboxes

Bonus round:
 - Selecting "Custom" role will allow to set **any** positions of checkboxes
    - Default state: all checkboxes unchecked

Role examples:
- Admin - all checkboxes enabled
- User - can't move/delete gems and folders
- Member - can only view and share gems and folders

Goals:
- [ ] Make checkboxes(if you want custom implementation to use there is provided images inside [materials folder](/materials)) and dropdowns components
- [ ] Callback on changing user role(dropdown) will return current role and checkbox state
- [ ] On button click invoke callback with current value with role and checkbox states


Bonus points:
- [ ] Simple responsive (not over the head but not broken)
- [ ] Component covered with unit/integration tests
- [ ] Readable and understandable types(TS)
- [ ] Dev docs - how to use component (as it like npm module)
- [ ] Build - script to minified lib version
- [ ] Crossbrowser prefixed styles + polyfills (production readiness + IE11)
